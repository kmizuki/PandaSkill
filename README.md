# Description

This repository holds the source code and data of the paper [PandaSkill - Player Performance and Skill Rating in Esports: Application to League of Legends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10049).

Player performances and ratings can be visualized [here](https://pandaskill.streamlit.app/).

# Installation

1. **Clone the repository with Git LFS:**

    Ensure you have Git LFS installed to handle large files. If Git LFS is not installed, follow these instructions to set it up.

    Then, clone the repository and pull the large files:

    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git clone https://github.com/PandaScore/PandaSkill.git
    cd PandaSkill
    ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
    Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    uv sync --upgrade
    ```

# Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results presented in the paper, follow these steps:

1. **Compute the features from the raw data:**
    - `uv run pandaskill/experiments/preprocess_data.py`
    - This is optional, as features are already precomputed in `pandaskill/artifacts/data/preprocessing`
2. **Compute the performance scores for each game:**
    - `uv run pandaskill/experiments/run_performance_score_experiment.py`
    - you can edit the configuration in the file itself, configurations used in the paper are provided
3. **Compute the skill ratings:**
    - `uv run pandaskill/experiments/run_skill_rating_experiment.py`
    - you can edit the configuration in the file itself, configurations used in the paper are provided

Results are located in `pandaskill/artifacts/experiments/`.
